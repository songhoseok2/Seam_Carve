### What is it?
Seam carving is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing. It functions by establishing a number of seams (paths of least importance) in an image and removing them in the resizing process. The purpose of the algorithm is image retargeting, which allows the users to resize images without distorting or losing significant portions of the image.
